## Data Specification

The dataset is from [Drinking Waste ClassificationStructureRSMAS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkadiyhacks/drinking-waste-classification) that contains 4828 images separated by class and has 4 classes. But because the scope of this application is not very large, our team focuses on 3 classes (AluCan, Glass, and PET). We also decided to add one more class (Unknown) from the dataset [Trashnet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet). For our baseline and transfer learning model, we generate more images using data augmentation.
